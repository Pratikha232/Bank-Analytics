# Bank-Analytics
The **Bank Loan Analytics** project focuses on analyzing the bankâ€™s loan portfolio, identifying key performance metrics, and uncovering trends that influence loan outcomes. Using historical data, the analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing lending strategies, managing risks, and improving decision-making processes.

Several tools were employed to ensure a comprehensive approach to data analysis:
- **MS Excel** was used for data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
- **MySQL** handled data querying and management.
- **Power BI** and **Tableau** were utilized to create dynamic visualizations and interactive dashboards, enabling users to explore insights effectively.

These tools facilitated the processing of large datasets, in-depth analysis, and clear presentation of findings for stakeholders.
